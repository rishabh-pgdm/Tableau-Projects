Conclusion (Findings) from the Dataset:
The dataset is skewed toward India and does not include all restaurant data from around the world.
Restaurants are rated in six different categories.
Although Connaught Palace has the most restaurants listed on Zomato, it does not offer online deliveries. The situation in Defense Colony and Malviya Nagar appears to be improving.
The following cuisine appears to be receiving good ratings at the top-rated restaurants: Italian-American Chinese-North Indian
There is no link between the price and the rating. Some of the highest-rated restaurants are also the least expensive, and vice versa.
In terms of common eateries, Indian restaurants appear to be better rated for breakfast and coffee, whereas American restaurants appear to be better rated for fast food chains and ice cream parlors.
